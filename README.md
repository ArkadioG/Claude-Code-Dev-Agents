A comprehensive collection of specialized Claude Code subagents designed to enhance your software development lifecycle. These domain-agnostic experts can be applied to any software project, from web applications to mobile apps, AI-powered systems to enterprise solutions.

## What are Claude Code Subagents?

[Claude Code subagents](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of development tasks. Each agent operates with its own context window, custom system prompts, and specialized expertise. They enable more efficient problem-solving by providing task-specific configurations that Claude Code can automatically delegate to or explicitly invoke.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Opinionated Technology Framework

This agent collection represents an **opinionated approach** to modern software development with specific technology preferences:

**Backend Preference:**
- Python ecosystem (FastAPI)
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- RESTful API design patterns

**Frontend Preference:**
- **Server-side first**: HTMX + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS for web applications
- React Native for mobile applications  
- Progressive enhancement over client-side SPAs

**Infrastructure Preference:**
- Cloud-native deployment
- Containerization with Docker
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

**Development Philosophy:**
- API-first design
- Security and compliance by default
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Comprehensive testing strategies

**If your technology stack differs significantly from these preferences, you may want to customize the agent system prompts to better align with your chosen technologies and methodologies.**

## Agent Collection

### üéØ Strategic Leadership
- **Product Owner/Development Manager** - Project coordination, backlog management, requirements analysis

### üíª Core Development
- **Backend API Architect** - System architecture, API design, technology decisions  
- **Backend Developer** - Python/FastAPI implementation, business logic, testing
- **Server-Side Web Developer** - HTMX, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS, modern server-side rendering
- **Mobile App Developer** - React Native, Flutter, mobile-specific integrations
- **Database Engineer** - Schema design, query optimization, data modeling
- **Cloud Infrastructure Engineer** - AWS/GCP/Azure, Terraform, containerization

### üîß Specialized Technical
- **AI/ML Integration Specialist** - Model deployment, ML pipelines, AI service orchestration
- **Security & Compliance Auditor** - Security frameworks, data protection, regulatory compliance
- **API Design Specialist** - REST/GraphQL design, API documentation, integration strategies

### ‚ö° Quality & Operations  
- **DevOps Pipeline Engineer** - CI/CD automation, deployment pipelines
- **Performance Optimizer** - Load testing, bottleneck analysis, optimization
- **Testing Strategist** - Test automation, QA processes, testing frameworks

### üìö Support
- **Code Reviewer** - Code quality, best practices, security reviews
- **Technical Documentation Writer** - API docs, architecture guides, user documentation

## Installation & Usage

### Option 1: Project-Level Installation
1. Clone this repository to your project root:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-dev-agents.git .claude/agents
   ```

2. The agents will be available immediately in your Claude Code session for that project.

### Option 2: User-Level Installation  
1. Clone to your user directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-dev-agents.git ~/.claude/agents
   ```

2. Agents will be available across all your Claude Code projects.

### Managing Agents
Use Claude Code's built-in agent management:
```bash
/agents
```

This opens an interactive interface to view, create, edit, and manage your subagents.

## How to Use

### Automatic Delegation
Claude Code will automatically delegate tasks to appropriate agents based on:
- Task description in your request
- Agent descriptions and expertise areas
- Current context and available tools

### Explicit Invocation
Request a specific agent by mentioning it:
```bash
# Use the backend developer for API implementation
@backend-developer implement the user authentication endpoints

# Use the cloud engineer for deployment
@cloud-infrastructure-engineer deploy this to AWS using Terraform
```

## Customization

Each agent is stored as a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. You can:

1. **Modify existing agents** to match your team's specific needs
2. **Add new agents** for specialized domains
3. **Adjust tool permissions** for security or focus requirements
4. **Customize system prompts** to reflect your coding standards

Example agent structure:
```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: "Brief description for Claude Code delegation"
tools: "optional,tool,list"
---

# Agent Name

[Custom system prompt content]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the Product Owner** - Use for breaking down requirements and planning
2. **Architect before implementing** - Use API Architect before Backend Developer
3. **Security first** - Involve Security Auditor for sensitive applications
4. **Document as you go** - Use Technical Documentation Writer throughout development

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create agents following the established format
3. Test agents with real development scenarios
4. Submit pull request with clear description of agent capabilities
